## Music Composition Tips

For Galageaux's arcade shooter theme:
- Use synth leads and pads
- Fast tempo (120-140 BPM for gameplay)
- Layer percussion and bass
- Boss music should be more intense
- Ensure smooth loops (no clicks at loop point)

## Music Resources

Free music sources:

Or consider commissioning a composer for original tracks.

## Adaptive Music

The gameplay music tempo automatically increases as the player progresses through levels (1.0x to 1.3x speed).

## Temporary Workaround

Until you add actual music files, the audio system will gracefully handle missing files and the game will work silently.
